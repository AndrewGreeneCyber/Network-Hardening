<h1>Analysis of Network Hardening</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This project outlines various hardening tools and methods, such as Multifactor Authentication (MFA), strong password policies, and regular firewall maintenance, to enhance network security. Implementing MFA requires additional verification beyond passwords, reducing brute force attack risks. Adopting strong password policies ensures unique, secure passwords, while regular firewall maintenance blocks malicious traffic. Additional recommendations include regular patch updates and disabling unused ports and applications to minimize the attack surface. These measures collectively aim to address current vulnerabilities, reduce the likelihood of future breaches, and build a robust security foundation.
